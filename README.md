# Data-Scientist-Salary-Prediction
Project 2 - Understanding the salary dataset and predicting the salary of a data scientist based on different locations

## Project Overview

## Summary
* Created a machine learning model that **estimates salary of data scientist based on the features like rating, company_founded, etc.**<br/>
* Consolidated the data from Glassdoor about salaries of Data scientists across different locations in the United States. 
* Analyzed the data to identify the min or max average/median salary across different locations and industries. 
* Performed feature engineering to create new features. 
* Identified top features using information gain & correlation matrix. 
* Build different regression models to estimate the salary range. 
* Random forest was selected as the best model among all using the Root Mean Squared Error metric. 

## Resources Used
* Packages: **pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn.**<br/>
